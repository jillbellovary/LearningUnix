research notes with my professor

Day 1

Prof explained a bunch of stuff to me and I didn't really understand any of it, but I pretended to

Day 2

I tried to read the paper that Prof assigned me and it's written in another language?

Day 3

we had a workshop today and it was fun

Day 4

I talked to my friend and she has no idea what her prof is saying either, huh

Day 5

Today I asked Prof a question, I was afraid Prof would think I'm an idiot,  but Prof explained it and now I have a clue what is going on

Day 6

Prof is proud of me because I made some progress, what?!  Cool I guess.
